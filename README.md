# calculator.py
i tried to use almost all the basics in a single file and it's completely terminal based
# Terminal game.py
this is just a fun little game using only terminal and text for options
# secret_text.py
this will make your given text into a junk text, when you give back the same junk text will return the original text
# Hangman.py
its just a normal hangam game which uses 1 files one for words (word.py)
# File_sorter.py
this will just move the files to the specified folders by taking extensions name
# Tkinter 
this is having most of the projects, i choosed this because its more challenging than normal terminal based
